This is a project that can convert text to a SQL query using OpenAI API for any MsSQL database.
The program automatically generates the SQL query based on the input text. In the example project I have used AdventureWorks2017 and SQL Server express to host the database. 

This project requires an OpenAI API key. You can get one from here: https://openai.com/product

See the example project on how to use the package.
