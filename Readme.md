This is a project that can convert text to a SQL query using OpenAI API for any MsSQL database.
The program automatically generates the SQL query based on the input text. In the example project I have used AdventureWorks2017 and SQL Server express to host the database. 
It can also be used to ask general question about the databasae and its structure.

This project requires an OpenAI API key. You can get one from here: https://openai.com/product

See the example project on how to use the package.

Nuget: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Text2Sql/1.0.2
